## Background

### Why weâ€™re doing this

In 2016, the Open Data Manual was created to demonstrate ideas for organizing important documentation about the Open Data Initiative. It became a convenient way to publish and keep information up to date (such as the current liaison roster), and quickly the site became a staple of Austin's open data operations. A few facts about our current situation: 

- We don't have many staff members on our core team with experience managing the software that powers the site (python's sphinx documentation generator)
- We do have staff members on our team who are comfortable using GitHub pages
- There is a broader need to harmonize messaging around open data, and a [landscape assessment](http://open-data-sprints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project-open-data-content-audit.html) is underway to better understand that need

**Problem statement:** We need to provide access to content currently stored in the Open Data Manual and maintain that content in a way that accomodates the skills and workflows of most current team members. 


## Project Plan

#### Goal
- Migrate content from the Open Data Manual into the open data training site, where it can be maintained until a more permanent content strategy plan is developed.


#### Milestones
- Inventory of items to migrate approved by open data leadership
- Plan for new item locations in training site approved by training site maintainer
- Content is transfered into new site
- Updated URL forwardings from opendata.rocks
- Open Data Manual marked as retired/archived

## Key partners
- Hailey Pate (open data manual creator, content mover)
- Happiness Kisoso (training site maintainer)
- Charles Purma (open data leadership, project sign off)


## Timeline
- to be completed by April 1, 2017

## Success criteria
- opendata.rocks works well, survives user testing
- liaisons.opendata.rocks directs traffic to the current liaison roster
