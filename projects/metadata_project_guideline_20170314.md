## Background

### Why weâ€™re doing this

As part of Open Data Sprint 2.3, we are preparing a [project to refresh  content](https://trello.com/b/uEryu4Lp/open-data-sprints-scrum-board?menu=filter&filter=label:Open%20Data%20Refresh) that's published on the open data portal. Publishers and editors will be asked to review their assets and take action to make sure metadata items are completed according to standard. 

A guideline document is needed to assist staff who will be participating in this activity. 


## Project Plan

#### Goal
- Develop a guideline document that staff can reference when participating in the open data refresh project


#### Milestones
- Prepare list of metadata items to be completed
- Determine which items need additional information beyond that which is provided by [Project Open Data](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/) 
- Develop special section for tags to help track open data value propositions
- Complete user testing and revisions
- Deliver final guideline

## Key partners
