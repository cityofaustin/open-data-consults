## Background

### Why weâ€™re doing this

The Office of Sustainability publishes a public dashboard that describes the City's progress toward meeting key sustainability goals. The dashboard is powered by data that lives in many different places, and the current process for updating the dashboard is manual and time-consuming. An automated process is needed to reduce the amount of manual work required, lower the opportunity to introduce errors into the data, and save staff time on task.

###Related ODI performance goals

We don't have these yet, but increased staff efficiency would likely be one of them. Also, this project will deliver work related to two Open Government Partnership focus areas: transparency and innovative technology.

## Project Plan

#### Goal
Make it easier for the Office of Sustainability to collect the data it needs to update its indicator dashboard

#### Milestones
- Identify data collection needs and related requirements
- Propose options for new data collection solution
- Assess feasibility of automatic data publishing between the collection tool and the dashboard (socrata)
- Design and test solution
- Customer sign off

## Key partners

Lewis Leff, Office of Sustainability
Hailey Pate, Open Data Team, Communications and Technology Management

## Timeline

Targeted for completion by April 1, 2017


## Success criteria
Upon completion of this project, it's easier for the Office of Sustainability to update its indicator dashboard than it was before. 


## Scope exclusions
- Automated publishing to Socrata (we'll try... but no guarantees)
