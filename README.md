# open-data-consults
CTM's Web Services team works on many projects related to open data, including:
- Receiving and tracking [new open dataset suggestions](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions)
- Helping departments create and [publish new datasets](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-pipeline)
- Drafting documents for an [open data manual](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-docs)
- ... and more!

This repo is for keeping track of the ["more" stuff](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-consults/issues).

We created an experimental view with items from all of our open data project repos... sort of old now, but still a cool proof of concept:
