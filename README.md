CTM's Web Services team works on many projects related to open data, including:
- Receiving and tracking [new open dataset suggestions](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-suggestions)
- Helping departments create and [publish new datasets](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-pipeline)
- Drafting documents for an [Open Data Manual](https://github.com/cityofaustin/open-data-manual)
- ... and more!

This repo is about keeping track of the "more" stuff.
